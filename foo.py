Yeah, it can feel like a lot. But here’s the good news: Python’s OOP model is way simpler than Java or C++. You don’t need to memorize anything. You just need to get a feel for how it behaves, piece by piece.

Let’s do this right. We’ll build it up step by step — no fluff, no random jargon, and plenty of real examples where you’ll write and break stuff to see how it works.

Here’s how we’ll go at it:

OOP Roadmap We’ll Follow

(You’ll get hands-on with each — I’ll push you to write things.)
	1.	Classes & Objects
	•	What are they?
	•	How to define and use them?
	•	What’s actually happening behind the scenes?
	2.	__init__ and self
	•	Why self is not optional.
	•	What happens when you call Foo("Mary")
	3.	Instance Variables vs Class Variables
	•	Mutability traps
	•	Default shared state bugs
	4.	Methods
	•	Instance methods
	•	Class methods (@classmethod)
	•	Static methods (@staticmethod)
	5.	Dunder (magic) methods
	•	__str__, __repr__, __eq__, __lt__, __len__
	•	__new__, __del__
	6.	Inheritance
	•	Basic
	•	Method overriding
	•	super()
	•	MRO (method resolution order)
	7.	Encapsulation, private-ish variables, @property
	8.	Advanced concepts
	•	Abstract classes
	•	Mixins
	•	Composition vs Inheritance
	9.	Edge Cases
	•	Object copying (copy, deepcopy)
	•	Identity vs equality
	•	Mutable defaults
	•	Singleton patterns
	10.	Real-world use cases

	•	Logger classes
	•	Config loaders
	•	Reusable validators
	•	Game object simulation (with inheritance)

You’re not supposed to know all of this from the start. That’s the whole point of learning it right. Just say the word, and we’ll start from class Foo: and build up — no skips.
